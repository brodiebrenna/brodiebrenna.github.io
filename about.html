								<p>Hi, my name is Brodie Brenna. I am an aspiring data analyst. I am currently taking the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and I have a number of personal projects that have given me background.</p>
								<p>Since I was young I have always been infatuated with solving problems. This included doing sudokus, playing RTS games, and really just figuring out how things work. Data analysis is ultimately just a giant puzzle.</p>
								<p>I started out doing data analysis on blockchain data back in 2017. Following this I got into data driven marketing to drive up the engagement factor for digital content creators that I worked for. My experience has given me the opportunity to learn how to communicate with a wide variety of clientele from those within academia to those just trying to get a business off the ground.</p>
								<p>My goals going forward are to improve my skills and get more certifications under my belt. Ideally form data analytics into a full time career. With this I would like to get formal education in a related program such as math or data science.</p>
								<p>If you are interested in working with me then please feel free to <a href="mailto:brodiebrenna@gmail.com">email me.</a></p>
